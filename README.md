# ElectoralRole
Data was pulled from the Public Electoral Role data for East Dunbartonshire (U.K.)

A new column calling the sex of the individual was added and the output based on the $FirstName of the individual. Potential levels of the variable $Sex were: Male, Female or ?. Where ? was called this means either that the name was unisex (e.g. Andy) or that no information could be found to guide whether the name was male or female.
